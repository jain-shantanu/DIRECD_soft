Optimizing DIRECD Performance
---------------------

DIRECD has been designed for maximum efficiency. However, performance can be affected by a slow or unstable internet connection, which may occasionally cause the interface to freeze or become unresponsive.

While we continue to develop a more robust solution, you can significantly improve the software's speed by following these steps:

**Download Data Manually**
    To avoid delays caused by downloading data during runtime, we recommend pre-downloading the required SDO data manually from `JSOC`_ or `MEDOC`_. 
    .. _JSOC: http://jsoc.stanford.edu/ajax/exportdata.html?ds=aia.lev1_euv_12s
    .. _MEDOC: https://idoc-medoc.ias.u-psud.fr/sitools/client-user/index.html?project=Medoc-Solar-Portal
   
**Disable Automatic Plot Saving**
    The automatic saving of plots can slow down processing. For a considerable performance increase, you can disable this feature. You will still be able to manually save any plot using the standard right-click 'Save As' option.
