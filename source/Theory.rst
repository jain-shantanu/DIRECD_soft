Introduction
====================

DIRECD (Dimming Inferred Estimation of CME Direction) is a novel method
to characterize the early CME propagation direction from the expansion of coronal dimmings.

Cone Construction
------------------------------------

Figure illustrates a 2D schematic of the cone structure. The red cone represents the radially oriented cone, while the blue cone is
inclined at an angle β relative to the radial direction. The parameter α denotes the half-width of the cone, point C marks
the source location, and O indicates the Sun’s center. The perpendicular height of point P from its orthogonal projection P\ :sub:`proj`
on the surface is denoted as H, and H\ :sub:`slant` represents the slant height of the cones.
