Acknowledging or Citing
=======================

If you use DIRECD for scientific work or research presented in a publication, please cite it by acknowledging in the main text its use and include the following citation:

.. note:: "Shantanu Jain et al. (2024). Coronal dimmings as indicators of the direction of early coronal mass ejection propagation. A&A 683 A15, DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/202347927"

Application of DIRECD:

To acknowledge DIRECD software, include the following:

.. note:: "This research has made use of DIRECD v?.?.?, an open-source and free Python package to estimate early CME direction from coronal dimmings (Zenodo: add link).".

changing the v?.?.? to the version you have used.

To acknowledge DIRECD in posters or talks include the project logo or icon.
