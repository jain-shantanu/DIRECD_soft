Introduction
====================

DIRECD (Dimming Inferred Estimation of CME Direction) is a novel method
to characterize the early CME propagation direction from the expansion of coronal dimmings.

Graphical User Interface
------------

The DIRECD-soft GUI is developed to provide the necessary tools to perform early CME direction analysis using 
coronal dimmings. This package has been built in Python (3.12) with an extensive use of libraries available within
the Python language ecosystem. The GUI of this application has been built based on Streamlit, an open-source Python 
library that provides an easy way to create web applications and tested on windows-based operating system.
